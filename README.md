# Data_Wrangle

## Introduction

For the Real-world data, it never came out clean and cleary. Data Analysis had to wrangle the data for the data to become easily understand and to be used. The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) for this project is the tweet archive of Twitter user Call WeRateDogs (@dog_rates). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. Overall, we can use the data set to analyze the question relative to the dog.
