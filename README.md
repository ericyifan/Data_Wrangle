# Data_Wrangle

Author: Yifan Yang

## Introduction

For the Real-world data, it never came out clean and cleary. Data Analysis had to wrangle the data for the data to become easily understand and to be used. The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) for this project is the tweet archive of Twitter user Call WeRateDogs (@dog_rates). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. Overall, we can use the data set to analyze the question relative to the dog.

### Gather
In the gathering section, I have to gather data from three sources (csv file, file in the server, and source frim api). The first source is a CSV file that is provided by Udacity. The second source is a tsv file I had to import from Udacity server.  The third source is I had to gather data from twitter.

### Assess
In the assess section, I had to analysis the three dataframe and find at least 8 quality issue and 4 tidiness issue. Quanlity issue is error data and tidiness issue is messey of the data (clearness of the data). The following is the quanlity and tidiness issue I found.

### Clean
In the clean section, I had to fix the quality and tidiness issues that I found in the Assess section. There is a two-part in this section. First, I fix the data error that I found in the previous section. Second, I correct the naming of the column and remove the useless data for me. At last, I combine all the data frames into one data frame.
